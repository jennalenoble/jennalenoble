### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jenna and I am a recent graduate from UBC with a BSc in Mathematics!

I am passionate about data analysis, machine learning and learning more about data science! I am currently working on an environmental and health data analysis project. 

Some of my favourite programming languages include **R**, **Python** and **SQL**.
